# Preventing Cyber Hacking Breaches using RF and MIP

This repository contains the internship project *"Preventing Cyber Hacking Breaches using RF (Random Forest) and MIP (Mathematical Integer Programming)".

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Cyber hacking breaches have become a significant threat to organizations, governments, and individuals. This project leverages *predictive modeling* and *data-driven analysis* to detect, analyze, and forecast cyber hacking incidents. Using *machine learning techniques* and *statistical models*, the system improves breach prediction accuracy and helps in proactive threat mitigation.

## ðŸš€ Features

* Predict hacking breaches using *stochastic models* and *machine learning*
* Analyze breach frequency and size trends over time
* Secure admin and user management for data upload and access
* Visual data analytics with charts for better decision-making
* Modular architecture for scalability and integration

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* *Programming Language:* Python
* *Framework:* Django
* *Database:* MySQL (via WAMP Server)
* *Tools:* Random Forest, ARMA-GARCH Models, Data Visualization Libraries

## ðŸ“Š Workflow

1. *Data Upload:* Admin/User uploads sensitive datasets.
2. *Data Processing:* System cleans and stores the data in the central database.
3. *Prediction:* Models predict breach frequency and possible attack vectors.
4. *Visualization:* Graphical representation (spine charts, bar charts, column charts) for analysis.
5. *Decision Support:* Insights guide preventive cybersecurity measures.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

* *Unit Testing* â€“ Validates individual modules
* *Integration Testing* â€“ Ensures smooth data flow between components
* *System Testing* â€“ Verifies overall functionality and accuracy
* *User Acceptance Testing (UAT)* â€“ Confirms usability and performance

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights

* Breach frequency is *increasing, though breach size is relatively **stabilizing*.
* Predictive modeling with stochastic processes improves forecasting accuracy compared to static distributions.
* Insights can support *risk assessment, **insurance planning, and **regulatory frameworks*.
